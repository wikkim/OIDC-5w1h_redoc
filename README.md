OIDC-5w1h_redoc
===============

The main goal of this project is to apply software architecture modeling to open source software projects.

We are using the MITREid Connect project to implement and evaluate our redocumentation methodology.

Two subgoals:
1. Explore software modeling as part of open source software development
2. Evaluate the value added to current open source project MITREid Connect by applying software architecture modeling.

Project members:
William Kim, Megan Boggess, Hao Guan
